    <b>How it works</b>
  </h1>
  <p style="background-color:rgb(100,100,200);font-size:24px;">
    <b>BB84 is a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol.</b><br>
    It was created in 1984 by Charles Bennet and Gilles Brassard.<br>
    The purpose of BB84 is to create secure one time pads or keys to use with classical encryption algorithms.<br><br>

    <b>There are three individuals involved in this protocol.</b><br>
    Alice - Sender<br>
    Bob - Receiver<br>
    Eve - Eavesdropper<br><br>

    <b>Each "qubit" has three values: bit, basis, polarization.</b><br>
    Basis determines what polarizations one can measure and send.<br>
    + basis for 0° and 90°<br>
    x basis for 45° and 135°<br><br>

    Each basis has two degree measures, one measure for 0 bit value, one measure for 1 bit value.<br><br>
  
    <b>Bit and polarization are locked, and determine each other.</b><br>
    0°   = 1 (+ basis)<br>
    45°  = 0 (x basis)<br>
    90°  = 0 (+ basis)<br>
    135° = 1 (x basis)<br><br>

    Alice sends Bob a predetermined amount of qubits to build their one time pad with.<br>
    If the receiver guesses the correct basis, they can infer the bit even if they guess the incorrect polarization.<br>
    This means any receiver, Bob or Eve, has a 50% chance of measuring the qubit correctly.<br><br>

    <b>BB84 relies on the "No-Cloning" theorem.</b><br><br>

    The No-Cloning Theorem states that Eve cannot measure a qubit in the wrong basis and send a clone of this qubit to Bob.<br>
    In practice, this means Eve has a 50% chance of guessing the correct basis.<br><br>

    If Eve guesses correctly, Eve can resend the same qubit to Bob with no issues.<br><br>

    If Eve guesses incorrectly, this is where the No-Cloning Theorem takes effect.<br>
    By the No-Cloning Theorem, Eve cannot measure a qubit on the incorrect basis and send an exact copy to Bob.<br>
    While Eve knows the correct basis, Eve cannot deduce the polarization.<br>
    Therefore Eve is forced to guess the correct polarization and will have 50% of sending Bob the correct qubit.<br><br>

    Bob then has a 50% chance of measuring this new qubit on the correct basis.<br>
    This means if Eve intercepts the qubit, Bob has a 25% chance of measuring it correctly.<br>
    50% * 50% = 25%<br><br>

    <b>
      To recap:<br>
      If Eve if present, Bob has a 25% chance of measuring each qubit correctly.<br>
      If Eve is absent, Bob has a 50% chance of measuring each qubit correctly.<br><br>
    </b>

    BB84 takes advantage of the probability of correct measurement to ensure secure communication.<br>
    When Alice and Bob compare the qubits sent and received, they will look at the measurement error rate.<br><br>

    If Eve is present, as key size increases, the error rate will approach 75%.<br>
    If Eve is absent, as key size increases, the error rate will approach 50%.<br><br>

    Acceptable error rate is up to Alice and Bob to determine. This simulation uses a 70% error rate threshold.<br>
    If the error rate is above this threshold, Alice and Bob will determine there is an eavesdropper (Eve) and will cease communication.<br><br>

    If Alice and Bob determine there is no eavesdropper, they can build and use their keys.<br>
    Keys are generated by using the qubits Bob correctly measured.<br>
    Alice and Bob compare the qubits sent to the qubits measured and select congruent bit measurements for the key.<br><br>

    At this point, the protocol is over. Alice and Bob can now be certain the key they generated is not known by anybody else.<br>
