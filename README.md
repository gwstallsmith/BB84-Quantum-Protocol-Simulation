## About

The BB84 Quantum Protocol Simulation is a project aimed at providing an educational and interactive tool to learn about the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol. This protocol, proposed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, allows secure key exchange between two parties based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

## How It Works

The simulation illustrates the key steps of the BB84 protocol, including the generation of quantum bits (qubits), the transmission of qubits through a quantum channel, the exchange of information between Alice and Bob, and the final key reconciliation and sifting process.

The BB84 protocol ensures that any eavesdropping attempts are detectable, allowing the two parties to establish a secure shared key.
